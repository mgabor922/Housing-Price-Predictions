# Housing-Price-Predictions
In the two Python notebooks I mainly tried out basic methods for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
After that I use ensembling to predict housing prices mainly relying on traditional machine learning algorithms.
Later I would like to add neural netowrks into the mix and see if I can imporve predictions in that way.
